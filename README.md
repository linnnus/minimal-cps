# Minimal CPS counter
This CPS counter was made out of spite, to prove a point. No CPS
counter needs a fucking ripple effect and yet that is exactly what you
will find on the top sites. This site doesn't do that.

Note that this site tries to mimic a very specific behaviour which is
supposed to be nice. I don't know, I'm not a Epic Gamerâ„¢. Even if this
behaviour is wack, my point still stands.

## TODO
* Better cross-browser compatibility.
* I'm a little worried about performance but I don't really know how
  we could improve it or if it even poses a problem.
