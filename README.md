# Minimal CPS counter
This CPS counter was made out of spite. No CPS counter needs a fucking
ripple effect and yet that is exactly what you'll find on the top
search results. That's absurd.

This site tries to mimic a very specific behaviour which is
supposed to be nice. I don't know, I'm not a Epic Gamerâ„¢. Even if it's
wack, my point still stands.

## TODO
* Better cross-browser compatibility
